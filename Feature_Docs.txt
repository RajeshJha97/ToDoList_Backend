Building a backend for a to-do list application involves implementing various features to manage tasks, user data, and interactions. Here are some essential backend features for a to-do list application:

1. User Authentication and Authorization:
   - User registration and login functionality to create and access personal to-do lists.
   - Password encryption and secure storage to protect user credentials.
   - Authorization mechanisms to ensure that users can only access their own tasks.

2. Task Management:
   - Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for tasks.
   - Assign a title, description, due date, priority, and status to tasks.
   - Allow users to organize tasks into categories or lists.

3. Data Storage:
   - Use a database to store user information, tasks, and related metadata.
   - Commonly used databases for this purpose include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite.

4. API Endpoints:
   - Design and implement RESTful API endpoints to expose the functionality to client applications (web, mobile, etc.).
   - Endpoints might include routes for creating, updating, and fetching tasks.

5. Task Sorting and Filtering:
   - Enable users to sort tasks by due date, priority, status, etc.
   - Implement filters to show tasks based on different criteria, such as completed tasks, overdue tasks, etc.

6. Task Reminders and Notifications:
   - Implement notifications and reminders to alert users about upcoming or overdue tasks.
   - Utilize push notifications or email notifications to inform users about task updates.

7. Sharing and Collaboration (Optional):
   - Allow users to share tasks or task lists with other users for collaboration.
   - Implement mechanisms to manage permissions and access control for shared tasks.

8. Error Handling and Validation:
   - Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and errors.
   - Validate user input to prevent incorrect or malicious data from affecting the application.

9. Data Synchronization:
   - If the application is used across multiple devices, ensure that data stays in sync across all devices for the same user.

10. Security:
    - Protect the application against common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

11. Performance and Scalability:
    - Optimize database queries and use caching mechanisms to improve performance.
    - Design the backend to be scalable and handle increased user loads.

12. Logging and Monitoring:
    - Implement logging to track application behavior and errors for debugging purposes.
    - Set up monitoring to keep an eye on the application's performance and user activity.

Remember that the actual implementation details may vary depending on the technology stack and framework you choose to build the backend. Additionally, it's essential to thoroughly test the backend to ensure its stability and security before deploying it to production.
